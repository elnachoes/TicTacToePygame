This is a basic tictactoe game I created to learn to code better with python and pygame

corbintictactoe_version3.py is my current working version written with just functions

corbintictactoe_version4.py is my experimental version I am writing to learn about 
classes 

Only version 3 works, version 4 is a test version I tried to make with object orientated programming but it doesn't work and its a mess
